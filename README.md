# HA Display Concept-1
Dashboards should be clean and concise, focusing on both user functionality and aesthetics. An emphasis on the user experience is paramount, even when developing something only you intend to interact with. 

This dashboard is my attempt at creating something that I like to look at and use, and that acts as a convenient control surface for my bedroom.

This is still a work in progress. I have various UI/UX ideas I'll eventually prototype and as I add dashboards to other areas in my house, the interface will naturally evolve. I'm also toying with creating custom cards and themes. I intend to update this repo/create new ones as that happens.

But for now, here's the raw YAML for a basic dashboard. Adapt it as you see fit.

## Requirements

[Digital Clock](https://github.com/wassy92x/lovelace-digital-clock)

[Simple Weather Card](https://github.com/kalkih/simple-weather-card)

## My Setup
I use a 2022 Fire HD 8 Plus running Fully Kiosk attached to [magnets](https://a.co/d/9uiYMhy) glued to the wall with these [plates](https://a.co/d/dLY14P0). I don't love the tablet, but it works well enough and looks good on the wall. For power I just have it plugged into a USB C cable (jankiest part of the setup).
